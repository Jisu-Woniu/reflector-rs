# reflector-rs

A test implementation of reflector — the Arch Linux mirrorlist fetcher — in Rust language.

## Features:

- Async programming with tokio
- HTTP requests with reqwest
- JSON serserialization/deserialization with serde
- Rich CLI support with clap (WIP)

This project is still in early stages, and most features do not work as expected.

## How to build

Run `cargo build` in the repo's root directory.
